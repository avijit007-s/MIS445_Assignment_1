     Inter Miami CF beat Sporting Kansas City 3-1 on Tuesday night to advance to the Concacaf Champions Cup round of 16 by a 4-1 aggregate final over two legs.

Lionel Messi opened the scoring with a masterful strike for Miami at Chase Stadium in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, with Tadeo Allende and Luis Suárez adding the other two goals to give the home side an easy win in the second leg.

The reigning MLS Supporters' Shield winners from 2024 beat SKC 1-0 in the first leg in Kansas City last week in a game in which Messi scored the only goal.

Miami will face Jamaican side Cavalier in the round of 16, with the MLS side hosting the first leg on March 6.

Memo Rodríguez scored for Kansas City. It was the team's first goal of 2025.

Miami scored on all three of its first-half shots despite SCK getting the majority of opportunities early, with six shots and three on goal.

Messi slipped a through ball to Suárez, then controlled Suárez's pass off his chest and rifled it past John Pulskamp into the bottom right corner. Messi also started Miami's second scoring opportunity with a perfectly placed ball into the path of Jordi Alba, who found Allende for the finish in the 45th minute.

Two minutes later, a misplayed touch by Kansas City's Jacob Davis led to a difficult goal for Suárez that he bounced past Pulskamp.<br>
